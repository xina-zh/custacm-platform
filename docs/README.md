# Documentation Index

This repository is expected to be developed by agents. Documentation is part of the engineering surface, not an afterthought.

## Read Order For Agents

1. [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) - hard project rules.
2. [agent/README.md](agent/README.md) - agent operating map.
3. [agent/context-map.md](agent/context-map.md) - directory and module map.
4. The nearest module `AGENTS.md` before editing a module.
5. [agent/doc-sync.md](agent/doc-sync.md) and [doc-sync-map.tsv](doc-sync-map.tsv) before opening a PR.

## Document Layers

| Layer | Files | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root rules | [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | Mandatory rules for agents and contributors. |
| Planning | [../TODO.md](../TODO.md), [../CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) | Human-readable todo list and MR outcome history. |
| Agent map | [agent/README.md](agent/README.md), [agent/context-map.md](agent/context-map.md), [agent/doc-sync.md](agent/doc-sync.md), [agent/changelog.md](agent/changelog.md), [agent/quality-gates.md](agent/quality-gates.md) | Fast context, update rules, changelog format, and verification commands. |
| Architecture | [architecture.md](architecture.md), [adr/](adr/) | Current architecture and durable decisions. |
| API | [api.md](api.md) | Implemented HTTP contracts only. |
| Operations | [logging.md](logging.md), [server-deployment.md](server-deployment.md), [../deploy/README.md](../deploy/README.md), [../deploy/UPDATE.md](../deploy/UPDATE.md) | Runtime, logging, deployment, and update workflows. |
| Module docs | `*/AGENTS.md`, `*/TESTING.md` | Local module context and test coverage notes. |

## Update Rule

When changing code, scripts, CI, deployment configuration, or module boundaries, update the matching docs in [doc-sync-map.tsv](doc-sync-map.tsv). The CI job runs [../scripts/check-doc-sync.sh](../scripts/check-doc-sync.sh) to enforce this for PRs.

Docs-only changes should still keep links and facts consistent, but they do not require Maven verification unless they change executable examples or configuration.
