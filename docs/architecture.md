# custacm-platform Architecture

## Phase

The current phase creates a small, evolvable backend skeleton. It should not lock in the final product model yet.

The first runnable slice is platform-owned auth. The second runnable slice is the training-data ODS warehouse model. Other product areas are represented by directories only and should be expanded later, one module at a time.

## Current Module Responsibilities

### platform-common

`platform-common` is a shared library area, not a service and not a container.

It currently contains general shared library modules and the reusable SQL task execution core.

Current and expected split:

- `common-core`: reusable backend primitives, including the SQL task DAG runner that reads a YAML manifest on every run, rebuilds an adjacency-list graph, validates DAG shape, and executes SQL nodes with one transaction per node.
- `common-web`: HTTP response helpers, exception handling, request context helpers.

Do not put business concepts such as `User`, `Article`, `TrainingDataset`, or editor documents in common modules.

### platform-auth

`platform-auth` is the first runnable module and owns the platform auth boundary.

Current implementation:

- stores local accounts in MySQL through `auth-infra`;
- hashes passwords with BCrypt;
- signs access tokens with an RSA private key in `auth-web`;
- validates platform JWTs with the matching RSA public key;
- keeps platform JWT parsing, role-to-authority conversion, current-user extraction, and shared URL security setup in `auth-core`;
- exposes login, current-user, own-password-change, and admin user-management endpoints.

There is no public registration flow. Admins create users directly or through batch creation. The first admin may be bootstrapped from environment variables at startup.

The platform roles are:

```text
admin
player
disable
```

Business APIs expose a single `role` string when a user is authenticated. Stored login accounts can be `admin`, `player`, or `disable`; `disable` accounts cannot authenticate. Unauthenticated visitors have no `role` value and are handled only through public endpoints. JWTs only emit authenticatable roles: `admin` or `player`.

HTTP authorization follows [authorization.md](authorization.md):

```text
/admin/**   -> admin-only
/player/**  -> player or admin
other paths  -> guest/public and do not parse JWTs
```

`admin` includes `player` capability in Spring Security authorities, so admin JWTs can call `/player/**` endpoints.

The platform student identity is one immutable string:

```text
studentIdentity = fixed-length student number + real name
example: 230511213黄炳睿
```

Do not split this identity into separate `student_no` and `real_name` fields in the platform model unless the product decision changes explicitly.

`studentIdentity` is the only user ID in platform business code. Other modules should store and reference this value directly when they need to associate data with a user. JWTs carry this value in the standard `sub` claim and carry the single role in `role`.

Current auth module shape:

```text
platform-auth/
  auth-domain/
  auth-app/
  auth-core/
  auth-infra/
  auth-web/
```

`auth-domain` owns account entities, account roles, and repository contracts. `auth-app` owns login, failed-login retry cooldown, admin user-management use cases, generated-password handling, and app-layer result models. `auth-infra` owns JDBC persistence, BCrypt, RSA JWT issuing, and Flyway migrations. `auth-web` owns HTTP controllers and HTTP-local request/response DTOs, including admin operation responses that can return a one-time plaintext password for newly created or reset accounts. `auth-core` remains the shared platform JWT parsing, authority conversion, public-key decoder, and URL authorization library for runnable services. Other runnable services should use `auth-core` to validate JWTs and extract `studentIdentity` plus `role`; they do not depend on auth HTTP DTOs.

### platform-training-data

`platform-training-data` owns the first training-data warehouse slice.

Current implementation:

- stores raw Codeforces submissions in `ods_codeforces__submission`;
- stores cleaned Codeforces submission details in `dwd_codeforces__submission`;
- stores Codeforces handle/problem first accepted intermediate facts in `dwm_codeforces__handle_problem_first_accepted`;
- stores Codeforces handle/date/rating accepted summaries in `dws_codeforces__handle_daily_rating_accepted_summary`;
- stores platform `studentIdentity` to Codeforces handle bindings in `codeforces_handle_account`;
- keeps Codeforces HTTP ingress, ingest application service, recent-lookback submission collector, collect batch type, ODS record, parser, writer, handle-account mapping, fixture, DDL, SQL task resources, SQL task manifest, Spring config, and tests in an independent OJ module;
- parses Codeforces fixture data into OJ-specific ODS records for repeatable tests;
- writes ODS rows through `CodeforcesOdsSubmissionWriter` and its JDBC implementation;
- exposes OJ-specific ODS ingest through each OJ module under `training-data-web`;
- uses platform RSA JWT resource-server validation for protected `/admin/**` and `/player/**` URL tiers, matching the auth module's converter.
- exposes OJ-specific ODS ingest under `/api/training-data/admin/**`, restricted to the platform `admin` role.
- exposes Codeforces recent-lookback submission collection under `/api/training-data/admin/codeforces/submissions:collect`, restricted to the platform `admin` role.
- exposes Codeforces handle-account creation and identity migration under `/api/training-data/admin/codeforces/**`, restricted to the platform `admin` role.
- exposes Codeforces warehouse refresh under `/api/training-data/admin/codeforces/warehouse:refresh`, restricted to the platform `admin` role.
- exposes Codeforces handle lookup by `studentIdentity` under `/api/training-data/codeforces/**` as a guest endpoint that does not parse JWTs.
- exposes Codeforces DWD/DWM/DWS read-side query endpoints under `/api/training-data/codeforces/**` as guest endpoints that do not parse JWTs.
- applies ODS/DWD/DWM/DWS and Codeforces handle-account table migrations from OJ modules through Flyway at `training-data-web` startup.

Current training-data module shape:

```text
platform-training-data/
  training-data-codeforces/
    app/
      account/
      collector/
      ingest/
      query/
      warehouse/
    collector/config/
    config/
    domain/
      collector/
      criteria/
      model/
      parser/
      repo/
      value/
    infra/
      collector/
      parser/
      repo/
    scheduler/
    web/
      account/
      collector/
      ingest/
      query/
      warehouse/
    src/main/resources/db/migration/
    src/main/resources/fixtures/codeforces/
    src/main/resources/sql/ods/
    src/main/resources/sql/dwd/
    src/main/resources/sql/dwm/
    src/main/resources/sql/dws/
    src/main/resources/sql/tasks/
  training-data-web/
```

The OJ boundary is vertical. Codeforces owns its entrance and data organization end to end:

```text
external source or fixture
 -> OJ HTTP ingress or Codeforces source client
 -> OJ ingest app service
 -> OJ parser/writer
 -> OJ ODS table
 -> OJ SQL task manifest and common SQL task runner
 -> OJ DWD/DWM/DWS tables
```

Codeforces also owns its current handle-account mapping because the only implemented binding is Codeforces-specific:

```text
studentIdentity
 -> Codeforces handle-account app service
 -> codeforces_handle_account
```

Admin identity migration for this mapping updates only `codeforces_handle_account.student_identity`; it does not update auth accounts and does not change the stored Codeforces handle.

Codeforces DWD/DWM/DWS transforms are SQL task resources. The current Java execution path is synchronous admin refresh: each request computes the batch's UTC+8 refresh interval from ODS submission times, reads the manifest, rebuilds and validates the DAG, then runs SQL files as set-based database work rather than row-by-row Java transformation. It supports manual resume with `startFromTaskId`, which executes the requested node and its downstream nodes only.

Codeforces recent-lookback submission collection is an OJ-owned source-ingestion use case. The admin HTTP entry accepts `studentIdentity` plus a positive lookback duration, resolves the identity to its bound Codeforces handle, and computes the right boundary from the service's current execution instant. The internal handle path pages Codeforces `user.status`, applies bounded connect/read timeouts and retry attempts to each source page request, reports per-handle status, and writes successful matches into ODS. The disabled-by-default Spring scheduled trigger calls the same app service daily at 12:00 by default with a rolling 120-hour lookback and collects all handles currently bound in `codeforces_handle_account`, de-duplicated by handle. It is not the future persistent pipeline scheduler; after ODS write, the code currently leaves a TODO for the future scheduler/orchestrator handoff.

There is currently no persistent pipeline run state or ADS physical table. OJ-specific DWD/DWM/DWS tables should stay independent until a concrete cross-OJ product query needs a unified view or ADS table.

Current physical data layer:

```text
ODS: ods_codeforces__submission
DWD: dwd_codeforces__submission
DWM: dwm_codeforces__handle_problem_first_accepted
DWS: dws_codeforces__handle_daily_rating_accepted_summary
Codeforces handle account: codeforces_handle_account
ADS: not implemented yet
```

`training-data-web` owns the runtime datasource, MySQL JDBC driver, and Flyway auto-migration. OJ modules own the actual migration scripts under their own `src/main/resources/db/migration/` directories.

`training-data-web` uses the same file logging contract as other runnable Spring Boot services: `LOG_DIR/combined.log` and `LOG_DIR/error.log`.

### Placeholder Modules

These directories exist to preserve product boundaries:

- `platform-blog`: future blog/content module.
- `platform-editor`: future external editor integration.
- `platform-article-storage`: future article storage module.
- `frontend`: future frontend implementation.
- `deploy`: future Docker/K8s deployment configuration.

Do not add them to the Maven reactor until their first runnable slice is being implemented.

## Dependency Direction

Within a business module, prefer this shape:

```text
web -> app -> domain
web -> infra -> domain
```

Rules:

- `domain` must not depend on `app`, `infra`, or `web`.
- `app` orchestrates use cases and should avoid direct infrastructure details.
- `infra` implements repositories and remote clients.
- `web` owns Spring Boot startup and HTTP controllers.

`platform-auth` now follows the domain/app/infra/web split because it owns account and credential data. `platform-training-data` uses vertical OJ modules because OJ data warehouses must own their own ingress and data organization.

## Cross-Module Calls

Each module exposes capabilities through its own `*-web` HTTP API.

If one module needs another module, the caller should define and use a local client/adapter. The target base URL must come from configuration, not hard-coded code.

Example future shape:

```text
content-app
  -> AuthClient
  -> content-infra HTTP adapter
  -> auth-web HTTP API
```

A gateway may be added later as a frontend-facing entrypoint. Internal service calls do not need to go through the gateway by default.

## Spring Boot Startup

Each runnable web service needs its own Spring Boot application class.

For package scanning, place the application class at the module package root. Example:

```text
com.custacm.platform.auth.AuthWebApplication
```

This allows Spring to scan:

```text
com.custacm.platform.auth
com.custacm.platform.auth.web
```

## Verification

Current verification commands:

```bash
./scripts/check-doc-sync.sh origin/main WORKTREE
mvn clean verify
./scripts/check-test-policy.sh
```

`check-doc-sync.sh` verifies that code/config changes include the matching documentation updates. `mvn clean verify` runs unit tests and JaCoCo coverage checks. `check-test-policy.sh` verifies that Java modules with executable source have tests and generated test/coverage reports unless explicitly allowlisted. Code-bearing modules should keep line coverage at or above `70%`; placeholder-only modules do not need tests until they contain executable code.

Run the packaging check when build artifacts or Docker image behavior changes:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Run `auth-web` locally:

```bash
java -jar platform-auth/auth-web/target/auth-web-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Default port:

```text
8081
```

Basic endpoints:

```text
GET  /health
GET  /module-info
POST /api/auth/login
GET  /api/auth/player/me
PATCH /api/auth/player/me/password
POST /api/auth/admin/users
GET  /api/auth/admin/users
PATCH /api/auth/admin/users/{studentIdentity}
```

`/api/auth/player/**` and `/api/auth/admin/**` require a platform bearer token issued by `auth-web`. Other auth endpoints are guest endpoints unless documented otherwise.

Run `training-data-web` locally:

```bash
java -jar platform-training-data/training-data-web/target/training-data-web-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Default port:

```text
8082
```

Basic endpoints:

```text
GET  /health
GET  /module-info
POST /api/training-data/admin/ods/codeforces/submissions:batch-upsert
```

Training-data `/admin/**` endpoints require a platform bearer token with the platform `admin` role. Guest endpoints do not parse JWTs.

Current response shape:

```json
{
  "studentIdentity": "230511213黄炳睿",
  "role": "player"
}
```

For local deployment, use:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
./scripts/deploy.sh
```
